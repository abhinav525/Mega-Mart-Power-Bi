# Mega Mart Data Analysis Power BI Project

This project focuses on analyzing the sales, customer data, revenue, returns, and various other aspects of Mega Mart using Power BI. The project utilizes DAX queries, SQL, and Excel to create a live interactive dashboard that provides valuable insights and solves business queries through visualizations.

The dataset for this analysis is sourced from multiple Excel sheets, which contain information about sales transactions, customer demographics, product categories, and geographical data. By leveraging the power of Power BI, we have created a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard that allows users to explore the data, uncover patterns, and gain actionable insights.

Key features of the dashboard include visualizations showcasing sales trends, revenue analysis by product category, customer segmentation by gender and zone, return analysis, and geographic distribution of sales. These visualizations provide a comprehensive view of Mega Mart's performance and enable decision-makers to make data-driven decisions.

In the project, we have implemented DAX queries to perform calculations and create measures for important metrics. SQL queries were used to extract and transform data from the underlying database, while Excel was employed for data preprocessing and cleaning before importing it into Power BI.

We encourage contributions to this project, whether it's in the form of issue reporting or pull requests for improvements. Feel free to explore the dashboard, provide feedback, and leverage the insights gained to drive business growth.
## Data


The data for this project is stored in multiple Excel sheets and covers the following aspects:

- Sales data
- Customer data
- Revenue data
- Return data
- Product categories
- Gender information
- Zone and city data

## Getting Started

To run and explore the Power BI dashboard, follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open Power BI Desktop (install it if you haven't already) and navigate to the cloned/downloaded repository folder.

3. Open the "MegaMartDataAnalysis.pbix" file.

4. In Power BI Desktop, go to the "Home" tab and click on "Refresh" to load the latest data from the Excel sheets. Ensure that the Excel files are in the same folder as the .pbix file.

5. Once the data is refreshed, you can interact with the pre-built visualizations and explore the insights and metrics related to the Mega Mart data.

## Queries and Analysis

The Power BI dashboard incorporates DAX queries, SQL, and Excel for data manipulation and analysis. Here are some key aspects of the project:

- DAX queries: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) are used to create calculated columns, measures, and perform complex calculations to derive insights from the data.

- SQL: SQL queries are employed to extract and transform data from the underlying database. These queries might be used to join tables, filter data, or perform other data operations.

- Excel: Excel is utilized for data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation before importing it into Power BI.

## Dashboard Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard provides various visualizations to explore and analyze the Mega Mart data. Some of the key visualizations include:

- Sales trends over time
- Revenue analysis by product category
- Customer segmentation by gender and zone
- Return analysis and reasons
- Geographic distribution of sales and revenue
